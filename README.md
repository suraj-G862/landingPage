## Design Choices and Libraries/Framework used

### Tailwind CSS
I extensively utilized Tailwind CSS to create an attractive and cohesive design, closely adhering to the Figma design provided.

### Nextjs
I chose Next.js for its powerful features, including server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG). This React framework excels at providing efficient routing and improved performance through SSR and SSG.

### Dynamic Data
Dynamic data is fetched from a JSON file (data.json) and displayed on the website, ensuring the content is up-to-date and easy to manage.

### Typescript
TypeScript was employed for type checking, enhancing code quality and maintainability through robust type safety.

### Design Adherence
The design strictly follows the Figma prototype provided by the company, ensuring a high-fidelity implementation of the intended user interface.

### Responsive
The website is fully responsive, offering an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
